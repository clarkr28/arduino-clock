# Clock v2

New Features:
- Correction for the constant drift of the microcontroller clock (turns out this microcontroller has a pretty accurate clock...)
- blur the seconds display over a couple pixels to make for a smooth animation instead of a harsh transition from one second to the next
- have the minute display fade out in the last seconds of the minute, then fade into the next minute
