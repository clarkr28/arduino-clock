# Time Drift Calibrator

Use this code to measure how much the internal clock drifts.  This code is essentially an upwards counting timer that allows the user to reference the elapsed time on the microcontriller against their own (more accurate) timer.  The timer will give a 10 second countdown to help the uset start their own timer in sync with the microcontriller.
